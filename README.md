 # Ethical Decision Making and Leadership Development Chatbot using Bhagavad Gita's Teachings

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an intelligent chatbot that provides ethical guidance and leadership development insights based on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand user queries and generate meaningful responses rooted in the Bhagavad Gita's wisdom.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need the following:

* Python 3.7+
* NLP libraries 
* TensorFlow for training the chatbot model
* A text editor or IDE

### Installation

Clone the project repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/seetharamarao817/Chatbot-using-Bhagavad-Gita-Teachings-
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Chatbot-using-Bhagavad-Gita-Teachings-
```

Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Chatbot

To run the chatbot's web interface, follow these steps:

1. Start the Flask web server:

```
python app.py
```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the chatbot interface.

### Training the Chatbot Model

To train the chatbot model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the training data by extracting relevant text from the Bhagavad Gita and pre-processing it.

2. Define the encoder-decoder model architecture and training parameters.

3. Train the model using the prepared training data.

4. Save the trained model weights for future use.

### Using the Chatbot

To use the chatbot, simply type a question or statement in the text box provided on the web interface. The chatbot will analyze your input and generate a response based on its understanding of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings.

## Project Highlights

* **Encoder-Decoder Model:** The chatbot is powered by an encoder-decoder model that enables it to understand and respond to user queries in a comprehensive and contextually relevant manner.
* **Bhagavad Gita's Wisdom:** The chatbot draws insights and guidance from the Bhagavad Gita's teachings to provide meaningful responses that align with ethical decision-making and leadership development principles.
* **Intuitive Web Interface:** The chatbot is accessible through a user-friendly web interface, making it easy for users to interact with and receive guidance from the chatbot.
